### High-Level Design for Implementing Azure Landing Zone in Existing Tenancy with Azure Verified Modules

#### 1. **Introduction**
This high-level design (HLD) outlines the architecture and key components for implementing an Azure Landing Zone within an existing Azure tenancy. It includes the use of Azure Verified Modules, providing pre-validated, enterprise-grade infrastructure as code (IaC) modules to ensure best practices, security, and compliance.

#### 2. **Architecture Overview**
The Azure Landing Zone will consist of several key components:
- **Management Groups**
- **Subscriptions**
- **Resource Groups**
- **Networking**
- **Identity and Access Management**
- **Policies and Governance**
- **Logging and Monitoring**

Each of these components will be defined and deployed using Azure Verified Modules and Bicep templates.

#### 3. **Management Groups**
Management groups provide a way to organize and manage access, policy, and compliance across multiple Azure subscriptions. The hierarchy will be defined as follows:

- **Root Management Group**
  - **Landing Zone Management Group**
    - **Production Subscription**
    - **Development Subscription**
    - **Sandbox Subscription**

#### 4. **Subscriptions**
Separate subscriptions will be created for different environments to provide isolation and cost management.

- **Production Subscription**: For hosting production workloads.
- **Development Subscription**: For development and testing purposes.
- **Sandbox Subscription**: For experimentation and POC projects.

#### 5. **Resource Groups**
Resource groups will be created to organize resources by lifecycle and ownership. Each resource group will contain resources related to a specific application or service.

- **Resource Group for Networking**
- **Resource Group for Shared Services**
- **Resource Group for Application Workloads**

#### 6. **Networking**
The networking architecture will include virtual networks (VNets), subnets, and network security groups (NSGs).

- **Hub-and-Spoke Topology**: A central hub VNet will connect to multiple spoke VNets.
  - **Hub VNet**: Contains shared services like firewalls and VPN gateways.
  - **Spoke VNets**: Contains application-specific resources.

Azure Verified Modules for networking will be used to ensure best practices and compliance.

#### 7. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
Azure Active Directory (AAD) will be used for identity management and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to control access to resources.

- **AAD Groups and Roles**: Define roles and permissions.
- **RBAC Policies**: Assign roles to users and groups at the management group, subscription, and resource group levels.

Azure Verified Modules for IAM will be used to standardize role assignments and policies.

#### 8. **Policies and Governance**
Azure Policy will be used to enforce compliance and best practices across the environment.

- **Policy Definitions and Assignments**: Create and assign policies for security, cost management, and operational best practices.
- **Initiatives**: Group related policies into initiatives for easier management.

Azure Verified Modules for policies will be used to ensure consistent and validated policy implementations.

#### 9. **Logging and Monitoring**
Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Azure Security Center will be used for monitoring and logging.

- **Log Analytics Workspaces**: Centralized logging for diagnostics and auditing.
- **Azure Monitor**: Setup alerts and metrics for resource monitoring.
- **Azure Security Center**: Implement security recommendations and threat detection.

Azure Verified Modules for logging and monitoring will be used to deploy standard configurations.

#### 10. **Bicep Templates with Azure Verified Modules**
Bicep templates will be created to define and deploy the infrastructure components, leveraging Azure Verified Modules for standardization and compliance.

**Example Bicep Templates:**

- **Management Group:**
  ```bicep
  targetScope = 'tenant'

  module mg 'br/public:managementgroup:1.0.0' = {
    name: 'managementGroup'
    params: {
      name: 'myLandingZone'
      displayName: 'My Landing Zone'
    }
  }
  ```

- **Subscription:**
  ```bicep
  targetScope = 'managementGroup'

  param subscriptionName string

  module subscription 'br/public:subscription:1.0.0' = {
    name: 'subscription'
    params: {
      displayName: subscriptionName
      managementGroupId: 'myLandingZone'
    }
  }
  ```

- **Resource Group:**
  ```bicep
  param location string = resourceGroup().location
  param rgName string

  module rg 'br/public:resourcegroup:1.0.0' = {
    name: 'resourceGroup'
    params: {
      name: rgName
      location: location
    }
  }
  ```

- **Virtual Network:**
  ```bicep
  param location string = resourceGroup().location
  param vnetName string
  param addressPrefix string

  module vnet 'br/public:virtualnetwork:1.0.0' = {
    name: 'virtualNetwork'
    params: {
      name: vnetName
      location: location
      addressSpace: [addressPrefix]
    }
  }
  ```

#### 11. **Deployment Process**
The deployment process will be automated using Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions to ensure consistency and repeatability.

1. **Template Development**: Create and validate Bicep templates locally.
2. **Source Control**: Store Bicep templates in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Perform testing in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

#### 12. **Security Considerations**
Ensure security best practices are followed:
- **Least Privilege Access**: Implement least privilege access for all roles.
- **Encryption**: Enable encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Security Baseline**: Apply security baselines and continuously monitor compliance.

Azure Verified Modules for security configurations will be used to enforce security policies.

#### 13. **Cost Management**
Implement cost management practices:
- **Budget and Alerts**: Set budgets and configure cost alerts.
- **Resource Tagging**: Tag resources for cost allocation and tracking.
- **Cost Analysis**: Use cost analysis tools to monitor and optimize spending.

#### 14. **Conclusion**
This high-level design provides a framework for implementing an Azure Landing Zone within an existing tenancy using Azure Verified Modules and Bicep templates. By following this design, organizations can ensure a scalable, secure, and well-governed Azure environment that supports their business needs and operational requirements.
